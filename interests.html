            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>When I'm not programming I'm playing/writing music, playing video games, putting
                together a puzzle, or watching tv.
            </p>
            <p>I was about 10 years old when I started to really love music. At the time I began
                learning how to play the guitar from my dad and violin in school. During my teen years
                I played guitar in a progressive metal band with my friends and violin in our school
                orchestra and chamber orchestra. Since high school I have played in several
                ensembles and over 15 musical theater pit orchestras.
            </p>
            <p>I began writing music at the end of high school and decided to add Music Composition
                as second major when I was at Keene State. I have composed for several sized ensembles,
                including string orchestra, string quartet, choir, and other various small ensembles.
            </p>
            <p>One of my more recent compositions, <em>Elemental Suite</em>, is inspired by one of
                my favorite shows, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>. This movement is inspired by
                the element air.</p>
