                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I originally went to college at Keene State College as a double major in Music Education
                    and Music Composition. I was a high school music teacher for a few years before realizing
                    that teaching wasn't for me. During COVID, I wanted to learn how to code for fun and
                    asked some friends to teach me how to code. This combination of finding a new skill and
                    losing interest in my career led me to the decision to change careers.
                    I have always loved different aspects of science. I love learning how
                    things work so becoming a software developer made sense.
                </p>
                <p>I began taking classes at Southern New Hampshire University at the beginning of
                    2022. I started learning Python and Java in my first few classes. I eventually
                    learned C++ as well. I've also learned about the software development lifecycle,
                    system architecture, and most recently a little about embedded systems and
                    basic AI programming.

                <p>One of my final projects for a college course was to create a full stack application using a MEAN stack.
                    This included using Express and Node to create a customer facing frontend website, MongoDB for the backend
                    database, and Angular to create a single-page application for the client's adminstratie purposes.
