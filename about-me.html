            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I originally went to college at Keene State College as a double major in Music Education
                and Music Composition. I was a high school music teacher for a few years before realizing
                that teaching wasn't for me. During COVID, I wanted to learn how to code for fun and
                asked some friends to teach me how to code. This combination of finding a new skill and
                losing interest in my career led me to the decision to change careers.
                I have always loved different aspects of science. I love learning how
                things work so becoming a software developer made sense.
            </p>
            <p>I began taking classes at Southern New Hampshire University at the beginning of
                2022. I started learning Python and Java in my first few classes. I eventually
                learned C++ as well. I've also learned about the software development lifecycle,
                system architecture, and most recently a little about embedded systems and
                basic AI programming.
